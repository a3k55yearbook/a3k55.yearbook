# For developers

While this project is still WIP, we are at the very last steps. 
I'm announcing Bootstrap integration, which will further optimize for mobile platforms while reducing the need for handling devices manually.

The Github Pages hosted website now should deploy directly from `main`, which means `dev` is no longer needed and will be merged before its removal. This will be the canary release.

The Vinh University hosted website will sync and deploy from this repository at my request. This will be the stable release.
